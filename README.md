# Introduction

I made this project for my university class `Computational Geometry` and it exploits ***Rational Quadratic Bezier Curves*** to describe the orbits of the planets.

# Solar System Unity3D

This project is based on C# on Unity 2018.3.4f1 Personal version. Simulated some planets in solar system:
- Sun
- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth System
  - Earth
  - Moon
- Mars
